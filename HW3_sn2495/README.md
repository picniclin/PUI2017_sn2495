HW # 3

Assignment 1:
Did this by myself.
1. Created random samples of varying lengths from 5 different distributions.
2. Then calculated the means of each sample
3. Plotted the mean vs the sample size
4. Calculated the mean of means
5. Plotted the histogram of  mean of means

Assignment 2:
Worked with Davey and Imran  on this part. Took Matts help to get the path to the citibike files. We referred to the skeleton notebook for the code to read data. We came up with the hypothesis as a group. I wrote the code for plotting the bar plot.

1. Read the data into a data frame
2. Formulate the Hypothesis
3. Display the hed
4. Remove the unnecessary columns
5. Display the head again
6. Created a list of indices of 'subscribers' and 'customers' among the user types
7. Calculated the means of each subset
8. Plotted the means vs user type

Assignment 3:
Worked on a part of this assignement in class until calculating the sample mean. Worked on the rest of it with Davey and Imran. In class I wrote the code to read the data and calculate the sample mean.  We referred to the class slides to get a hint on how to calculate and interpret the Z-score. 

1. Read the data into a table
2. calculated the sample mean and sample std
3. Got the population mean and std from lecture slides
4. Calculated the z-score
5. Based on the Z-score we rejected the null hypothesis
