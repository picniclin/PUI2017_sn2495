# PUI2017_sn2495

Course : PUI
Term: Fall 2017

The following steps helped to set up the environment:
1. Create a folder called PUI2017 on the local drive
2. Create an environmental variable and alias to access the folder easily. Setting the environmental variables worked right away
following screenshot shows the changes to the .bashrc

3. Verified that the alias works.Setting the alias did not work initially. On going through the instructions again, I realized that the changes were not saved. So used the 'Source' command to save the changes. After that the alias was working as expected
