HW5

Assignment 1:
Worked on it mostly on my own. Chose poisson distribution with mean and variance of 64. This was the more straight forward one 
among the assignments in HW5. The only confusing part was the requirement to plot the 'original distribution'. Was not sure what 
that exactly meant. If I considered Poisson as my original distribution, then the next plot would be very similar to the first. So
plotted a normal distribution for the 'original distribution'.



Assignment 3: 
Took help from Valeria and Matt while working on this one. 
Getting the data into the right shape took some time. And then the plotting. The plotting is cumbersome but not difficult. The 
code provided in the skeleton notebook helped as reference for most parts of this assignment. And this assignment took the most
time to complete among HW5 assignments
