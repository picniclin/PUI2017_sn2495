This is the Read me file for HW2

Working with: Matt,Valeria, Imran and Davey

Overview of HW2:

1. Requested an API key from MTA. Got a response in 5 mins!
2. Created the HW2_sn2495 folder in PUI2017_sn2495
3. Wrote the code to get JSON files from MTA SIRI Vechicle Monitoring System based on the example from the lab notebook
4. Assignment1: Initially Matt wrote the code on his system while me, Davey and Valeria assisted him. We discussed what would be the best python command to use and how to look at the keys in the dictionary structure. After we had a proof of concept on Matt's laptop, I wrote similar code on my system to implement the same. 
5. Assignment2: Worked similarly as assignment1. We discussed how to get the NA values. After we saw the proof of how it works on Matt's system, I implemented similar code on my system.
6. Assignment3: I had trouble getting the environmental variables working. Dropped by Dr. Federica's office on Wednesday to get help. The issue was resolved once I switched to the 2016_python2 kernel. I used the same data as the rest of the group. Took Davey's help to figure out some of the details. This part of the assignement was quite straight forward.
