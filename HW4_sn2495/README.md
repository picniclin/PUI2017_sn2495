# Assignment 3
Worked with Valeria, Alex, Davey and Imran on this assignment. Followed what was done in the lab and it was straight forward. I created the 2x2 matrix and entered the values to the calculate chi square function

# Assignment 4
Worked with Davey on this one. I have not written the code but just followed along. Just kept my head above the water
