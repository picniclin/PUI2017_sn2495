Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.
Hypothesis:  average reduction in fat% through diet control is higher than the average reduction in fat% through excercise

This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data on the incidence of diabetes for the US population.
