HW7 - PUI2017

Assignment 1: I worked with Davey and Imran on this. The 3 of us worked on HW3 Citibike assignment and we continued from where we left off.
We picked the t-test to compare the means of the 2 populations. Me and Davey picked 2 different months to apply the tests. I wrote the code 
for applying the tests. Initially I was running into issues and getting 'NaN' for the t-score and p_value. But later once I omitted the 
'NaN's in the data, I was getting the right values. 
Even though our H0 mentions a significance value of 0.05, since we were using a one-tailed test, we compared the P-values obtained to 0.025.
Interestingly, for Jan 2017, we could not reject our null hypothesis but for July 2017 we rejected the null hypothesis. It can be explained
from the fact that Customers are probably tourists who use the bike longer only in summer. The temperature has an impact on how long the 
customers ride the bike.

Assignement 2: Again worked with Davey and Imran on this. We collaborated on Autherea. Davey did most of the write up. I contributed the
methodology part of the write up.
