HW6: 
I worked on this assignment by myself. 

First I downloaded the data and saved in the local folder named PUIdata which is accessed by the environmental variable PUIDATA.
I was able to read the data into data frames. Cleaning and munging the data took some time because I was trying to figure out
which columns to keep and which ones to drop. 

I followed along the instructions. I was again stuck for a bit on fitting the OLS models because of an error. Then figured out
that I was passing arrays of different sizes. It took me while but once I figured this one, the sailing was smooth. 

When fitting the quadratic regression model, initially i forgot to take the log values and was getting very low R-squared. This 
made me think and look for why that happened. Again, I was stuck here for sometime but once I figured it out, the rest was 
straightforward.
